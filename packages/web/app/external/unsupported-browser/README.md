## Browser Support Check

`check-browser-support.min.js` and `unsupported-browser-styles.min.css` are manually minified
versions of their source files and the CSS is prefixed using `Autoprefixer` online. These files have
been committed because they aren't regenerated in the build step because we don't expect them to
change often.
